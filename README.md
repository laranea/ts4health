### Code

- [Health and Self Time Series Data Visualization with Python](https://github.com/markwk/time_series_data_analysis_for_health/blob/master/Health_and_Self_Time_Series_Data_Visualization_with_Python.ipynb) - Time Series Data Visualization using Fitbit or Apple Health Data for sleep and steps with primary focus being looking for trends, seasonality (esp day of week) and plotting autocorrelation function (i.e. lag). 
- Also see: [Time Series Data Visualization with Python](https://github.com/markwk/time_series_data_analysis_for_health/blob/master/Time_Series_Data_Visualization_with_Python.ipynb) - a standard example of time series data analysis and visualization using temperature data. 

### Data

Data collection was done on a combination of wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Oura). Data aggregation was done using [QS Ledger](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger), an open source Python project for collecting and visualization of self-tracking data (Fitbit, Apple Health, Oura, etc). Each data set was then processed and aggregated into a standardized format. For additional information refer to [QS Ledger](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger) or see my previous speech [Python For Self-Trackers](https://github.com/markwk/python4selftrackers) for a walkthrough. 

Sample data is not being provided openly at this time. Please contact the author if you are in need of reference data or are interested in further data or analysis collaboration.
